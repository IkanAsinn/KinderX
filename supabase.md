1. Configure MCP
Set up your MCP client.
Details:
Add this configuration to ~/.gemini/antigravity/mcp_config.json:
After saving the config, restart Antigravity. It will prompt you to complete the OAuth flow to authenticate with Supabase.
To edit the config from within Antigravity, click the ···menu at the top of the Agent pane > MCP Servers > Manage MCP Servers > View raw config. From the Manage MCP Servers page you can also Refresh server configs and enable/disable servers.
If you run into authentication issues, open Agent Settings with Cmd+, (Mac) or Ctrl+, (Windows/Linux), navigate to the Customizations tab, and click the Authenticate button next to the Supabase server.
